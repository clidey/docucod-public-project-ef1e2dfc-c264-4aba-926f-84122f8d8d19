## A Typical Release Workflow

1. **Planning**: New features and fixes are prepared and merged into the v10 branch.
2. **Tagging**: Using `scripts/release.sh` and `scripts/tag.sh`, maintainers generate version tags and update dependencies.
3. **Testing**: The Makefile targets run comprehensive tests including race detection, benchmarks, and linting.
4. **Publishing**: Tags and source code are pushed to GitHub, and detailed release notes are published.
5. **User Consumption**: Developers read release notes here, adapt their code, and take advantage of improvements.
