# Bug Fixes & Patches

This page catalogs all significant bug fixes, performance patches, and stability improvements introduced in each go-pg release. Keeping track of these changes is essential for developers aiming to maintain robust applications, resolve regressions, and understand the evolution of the library's operational reliability.

## Structure of Bug Fix Documentation

Each release section includes:

- **Release Version & Date**: The version number and official release date.
- **Issue References**: Identifiers or descriptions of resolved bugs.
- **User Impact**: Clear explanation of the problem and its resolution.
- **Behavioral Changes**: Details on any side effects or fixed regressions.
- **Workarounds**: Suggestions for temporary fixes if relevant.
- **Contributors**: Acknowledgments of contributors who helped fix issues.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Patches

### Version 10.x.x (YYYY-MM-DD)

- **Fix: Slice Model Scanning Stability**
  - Resolved improper allocation issues in sliceModel scanning, preventing unexpected runtime panics during bulk selects.
  - Ensures correct reinitialization of slice backing arrays to avoid memory leaks.

- **Fix: Relation Join Condition Validation**
  - Corrected validation logic in manyModel and m2mModel to guarantee join keys correctly match base model primary keys, reducing silent query failures.
  - Added explicit error reporting when join conditions are mismatched.

- **Fix: UpdateQuery Bulk Update Empty Slice Handling**
  - Added error detection to prevent silent acceptance of empty slices in bulk updates, ensuring users are informed immediately when an update operation cannot proceed.

- **Fix: Soft Delete Hook Execution**
  - Stabilized soft delete field setting in sliceTableModel and structTableModel, ensuring hooks run as expected with proper error handling.

- **Fix: Composite Key Scanning and Hook Calls**
  - Improved scanning for composite primary keys especially in structTableModel, preventing hook execution on nil or invalid data structures.

- **Fix: Function Model Error Propagation**
  - Ensured that errors returned from user-supplied function models are properly propagated and not suppressed during query execution.

### Patch Notes Highlights

- Improved error message clarity throughout model scanning routines.
- Fixed several edge case panics related to pointer value dereferencing in relation joins.
- Streamlined column scanner addition for slice models to avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
- Ensured consistency in query parameter appending for both single objects and slice models.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues Addressed

- **Unexpected nil pointer dereference during query relation loading**
  - Rooted in incorrect join key mapping; patch ensures explicit error if misconfiguration detected.

- **Bulk update silently succeeds with no changes when slice is empty**
  - Now returns clear error to prevent confusion and data integrity issues.

- **Hook methods (BeforeInsert, AfterUpdate, etc.) not invoked during batch operations**
  - Fixed by refining hook call logic inside sliceTableModel to process each element correctly.

- **Runtime panics caused by improper nextElem functions in Slice Models**
  - Addressed by improved validation and construction of nextElem closures.

## Best Practices for Applying Patches

- Always update to the latest patch version to benefit from critical fixes.
- Review your model definitions, especially relations and slice mappings, after upgrading.
- Validate your application's error handling to catch newly surfaced errors from stricter validations.
- Use provided error messages as guidance to correct query join configurations and data integrity issues.

## Example: Handling a Bulk Update Error After a Patch

```go
var users []User // an empty slice
result, err := db.Model(&users).Update()

if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Update failed: %v", err)
}
```

After the patch, the above code will return an error indicating bulk update on an empty slice is invalid, allowing immediate corrective action.
