# Version Overview

This page presents a clear, high-level summary of go-pg's major and minor releases, their release dates, and the primary themes or focus areas for each version. It helps users grasp how the library has evolved over time, highlighting critical milestones, key improvements, and strategic shifts in the project's development.

## Understanding go-pg Release Versions

The go-pg project employs semantic versioning with versions typically structured as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 10.15.0). Users can interpret these numbers to understand the nature of each release:

- **Major versions** (e.g., 10.x.x) introduce significant features and possibly breaking changes.
- **Minor versions** (e.g., 10.15.x) add incremental features or enhancements without breaking compatibility.
- **Patch versions** (e.g., 10.15.0) primarily provide bug fixes and stability improvements.

Each released version reflects a step forward in the go-pg ecosystem, balancing the addition of powerful new capabilities with reliability and performance refinements.

## Recent and Notable Releases

### Latest Release: 10.15.0
- **Release Date:** [Refer to official release announcements]
- **Focus:** Continued maintenance with critical fixes and minor improvements.

### Key Historical Milestones (Representative Examples)
- Transition to **go-pg v10**, marking a major stable iteration with enhanced PostgreSQL type support, more flexible query building, and optimized connection pooling.
- Introduction of bulk and batch operations, enabling large-scale inserts, updates, and deletes to improve application performance.
- Expanded transaction and prepared statement API to encourage safe, efficient database operations.
- Integration support for PostgreSQL's LISTEN/NOTIFY system alongside performant bulk data copy features (COPY FROM/TO).
- Enhanced observability with built-in debugging hooks and OpenTelemetry tracing compatibility.

## Changelog Flow and User Impact

This overview is designed from user intent: to quickly identify what capabilities and reliability improvements have shipped in each version without diving into internal implementation details.

- Users considering upgrades can reference this summary to assess the value and risk associated with moving between versions.
- Developers tracking project evolution gain insight into the pacing and directional focus of development efforts.

## Best Practices for Using Version Information

- Always check for **breaking changes** or **deprecations** in major releases; upgrade guides are available in the changelog for detailed migration instructions.
- Use patch and minor releases to obtain the latest bug fixes and performance improvements safely.
- Track release cadence to plan integration and testing cycles effectively.

# Example: Checking Current Version Programmatically

You can retrieve the installed go-pg version in code to ensure compatibility or troubleshooting accuracy:

```go
package pg

// Version returns the current release version.
func Version() string {
    return "10.15.0"
}
```

Use this in your application or tooling to verify which go-pg release you are working with.
