# Installing go-pg

This guide provides clear, actionable steps to add the go-pg PostgreSQL client and ORM to your Go project. You'll learn how to install go-pg using Go modules, verify the correct version, and avoid common pitfalls that first-time users often encounter.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **Go 1.18 or later** installed with module support enabled.
- A working Go module initialized in your project (`go.mod` file).
- Reliable internet access to fetch the module.

If you have not yet initialized a Go module, run:

```shell
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
go mod init github.com/my/repo
```

This will create a new module ready to manage dependencies.

<Tip>
Using Go modules is essential, as go-pg requires it for proper versioning and dependency management.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Installing go-pg

To add go-pg to your module, run the following command in your project directory:

```shell
go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```

- Note the explicit **`/v10`** suffix in the import path â€” this is critical for fetching the correct major version of go-pg.

- Omitting `/v10` is a common mistake that results in resolving an older or incompatible version.

This will download and add go-pg version 10 as a dependency in your `go.mod` file.

<Tip>
If you want to upgrade or ensure the latest patch version is used, run:

```shell
go get -u github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```

This keeps your go-pg dependency current.
</Tip>

---

## 3. Verifying Installation

After installation, verify that go-pg is included correctly:

1. Open your `go.mod` file and confirm a line similar to:

```go
require github.com/go-pg/pg/v10 v10.x.y
```

where `v10.x.y` represents the installed version.

2. Add a simple import line to one of your source files:

```go
import "github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
```

3. Run a minimal example to confirm that the package compiles and works as expected (see below).

---

## 4. Minimal Example to Confirm Setup

Create a file `main.go` with the following content:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
)

func main() {
	db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
		User: "postgres",
	})
	defer db.Close()

	var n int
	_, err := db.QueryOne(pg.Scan(&n), "SELECT 1")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	fmt.Println("Connection successful, SELECT 1 returned:", n)
}
```

Run:

```shell
go run main.go
```

Expected output:

```
Connection successful, SELECT 1 returned: 1
```

This confirms go-pg is installed and working.

## 5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

- **Missing `/v10` in import or `go get` command:**

  - Always include `/v10` in your import path and `go get` command.

- **Not initializing a Go module:**

  - Running `go get` outside a module-enabled project may fail or place dependencies incorrectly.

- **Outdated Go version:**

  - Ensure you are using Go 1.18+ to avoid module compatibility issues.

- **Incorrect package import:**

  - Verify imports use `github.com/go-pg/pg/v10` exactly; do not omit the version suffix.

- **Cached or stale dependencies:**

  - Use `go clean -modcache` if you suspect corrupted or outdated cached modules.

---

## 6. Next Steps

Now that go-pg is installed:

- Proceed to the **[Configuration & Connecting to PostgreSQL](https://pg.uptrace.dev/getting-started/setup/configuration-setup)** guide to configure database credentials and establish active connections.
- Explore the **[Quickstart: Your First Successful Query](https://pg.uptrace.dev/getting-started/first-use/quickstart-first-successful-query)** for hands-on query execution.
- If you encounter issues, refer to **[Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](https://pg.uptrace.dev/getting-started/first-use/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues)**.

<Check>
Make sure your project is in module mode (`go mod init` run).
Always include `/v10` in import paths and in your `go get` commands.
Verify Go version compatibility (1.18 or newer).
