# Prerequisites & System Requirements for go-pg

This page outlines the essential environment and system requirements to successfully use go-pg, a PostgreSQL client and ORM for Go. By ensuring your development environment meets these requirements upfront, you reduce the risk of installation issues and runtime errors.

---

## 1. Supported Go Versions

- **Minimum Go Version:** go-pg supports the last two major Go releases as of the current version.
- Make sure your Go installation is up to date with modules support enabled.

> The recommended approach is to use Go modules to manage dependencies cleanly:
>
> ```bash
> go mod init github.com/my/repo
> go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
> ```
>
> This ensures compatibility and easy upgrades.

---

## 2. PostgreSQL Server Requirements

- Compatible with PostgreSQL versions **9.0 and newer**.
- Supports standard PostgreSQL authentication methods including:
  - Cleartext Password
  - MD5 Password
  - SASL (SCRAM-SHA-256)
- Supports SSL and TLS connections with configurable TLS options (e.g., `TLSConfig` in connection options).

> go-pg expects standard PostgreSQL protocol messages and security handshakes; non-standard proxies may cause connection issues.

---

## 3. Operating System and Platform Considerations

- Tested and supported across major OS platforms:
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows

- No special OS-specific dependencies beyond the Go runtime and standard networking.
- For Unix domain socket connections, use the network option `unix` and provide the socket path.

---

## 4. Network and Connectivity Requirements

- Network access to the PostgreSQL server on port **5432** by default, unless customized.
- Firewalls and security groups should allow TCP connections on the PostgreSQL port.
- If using SSL/TLS, ensure proper certificate trust or configure `InsecureSkipVerify` as needed.

---

## 5. System Resource Recommendations

- **CPU:** No strict minimum, but connection pool size defaults to `10 x number of CPU cores`.
- **Memory:** Sufficient RAM to handle your application workload plus Go runtime memory needs.
- Connection pooling parameters (e.g., pool size) should be tuned to fit your server and application capacity.

---

## 6. Environment Variables & Default Credentials

If options are not explicitly configured in code, go-pg reads connection settings from the following environment variables:

| Variable        | Default    |
|-----------------|------------|
| `PGHOST`        | localhost  |
| `PGPORT`        | 5432       |
| `PGUSER`        | postgres   |
| `PGPASSWORD`    | postgres   |
| `PGDATABASE`    | postgres   |

Configure these in your shell or CI environment if defaults do not apply.

---

## 7. Common Dependencies

- Go runtime with module support.
- PostgreSQL server accessible with valid user credentials.
- Optional: TLS certificates for secure connections if enabled.

---

## 8. Validation Before Installation

To avoid common pitfalls:

- Verify Go version:

  ```bash
  go version
  ```

- Check PostgreSQL version and accessibility:

  ```bash
  psql --version
  psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-db
  ```

- Ensure network access:

  ```bash
  telnet your-host 5432
  ```

- Validate environment variables:

  ```bash
  env | grep PG
  ```

---

## 9. Best Practices and Tips

- Always pin your Go module dependencies to avoid upstream breaking changes.
- Use environment variables in production to manage secrets instead of hardcoding credentials.
- Configure TLS parameters carefully to achieve the desired security posture.
- Tune connection pooling options (`PoolSize`, `MinIdleConns`, `IdleTimeout`) based on your application workload and PostgreSQL server configuration.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

<Tip>
If you encounter connection timeouts or authentication failures, first check your PostgreSQL server logs for errors and verify the network path and credentials.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Using incorrect PostgreSQL version or unsupported authentication methods will cause connection failures.
</Warning>

<Note>
Refer to the “Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues” page in this documentation for detailed diagnostic steps.

| Requirement                 | Recommendation / Default                      |

- [Core Concepts & Terminology](/overview/product-intro-core-concepts/core-concepts-terminology)
- [Architecture Diagram & System Components](/overview/architecture-integration/architecture-diagram)

## Sample Environment Variable Configuration

```bash
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=postgres
export PGDATABASE=postgres
```

This sets defaults that go-pg will pick up if no other options are specified.

---

## Example: Connecting with Explicit Options in Go

```go
import (
    "github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
)

func connect() *pg.DB {
    db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
        Addr:     "localhost:5432",
        User:     "postgres",
        Password: "postgres",
        Database: "mydb",
    })
    return db
}
```

This example assumes the prerequisites above have been met.

---

## Summary

By following these prerequisites and system requirements, you set a solid foundation to install, configure, and run go-pg efficiently. Proper environment validation saves time and ensures a smooth development experience with PostgreSQL and Go.
