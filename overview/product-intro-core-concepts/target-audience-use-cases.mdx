## Who Should Use go-pg?

### 1. Go Backend and API Developers

- **Goal**: Build efficient, reliable backend services with seamless database integration.
- **Why go-pg?** It offers a natural and idiomatic way to model your database in Go and execute complex queries with minimal boilerplate.
- **What they gain**: Rapid development with ORM conveniences plus the power to drop down to raw SQL when needed.

### 2. Data Engineers and Backend Architects

- **Goal**: Manage large data flows, perform batch operations, and orchestrate complex transactions.
- **Why go-pg?** Robust support for bulk inserts, updates, deletes, transactions, and connection pooling ensures scalability and reliability.
- **What they gain**: Simplified data pipelines and improved maintainability of database-heavy applications.

### 3. Teams Building Microservice Architectures with PostgreSQL

- **Goal**: Deliver modular services that interact efficiently with PostgreSQL.
- **Why go-pg?** Its stable and high-performance client fits naturally into microservices, enabling strong ecosystem integration and safe query handling.
- **What they gain**: Reduced overhead in database interaction layers and confidence in connection management.

### 4. Developers Creating RESTful and GraphQL APIs

- **Goal**: Serve flexible APIs backed by powerful relational models.
- **Why go-pg?** Rich ORM relationship support (has-one, has-many, many-to-many) makes building complex data interfaces straightforward.
- **What they gain**: Cleaner API implementations and faster development cycles.

### 5. Real-Time Apps and Event-Driven Systems

- **Goal**: Build applications that respond instantly to database changes.
- **Why go-pg?** Native support for PostgreSQL notifications with `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` enables real-time event handling.
- **What they gain**: Simplified event architectures with tight database integration.

## Common Application Scenarios & Success Stories

### Microservices with PostgreSQL Backend

Microservices often require reliable, low-latency database access with clear ownership of data. go-pg facilitates this through easy-to-define models, transaction support, and connection pooling, all designed to keep services responsive and maintainable.

### RESTful APIs Serving Relational Data

For teams exposing PostgreSQL data through REST or GraphQL, go-pg streamlines mapping complex relationships and handling queries with minimal effort. Use cases include user management, content platforms, and organizational tools.

### Bulk Data Processing & ETL Pipelines

Data engineers rely on safe bulk inserts, updates, and deletes for efficient data ingestion and transformation. go-pg's batch support and timeout controls ensure that large datasets are processed reliably.

### Real-Time Event-Driven Applications

Applications like chat systems, live dashboards, or alerting mechanisms benefit from go-pg's integrated `LISTEN/NOTIFY` support, reducing complexity and improving reaction times.

## What Does Using go-pg Change for You?

| Scenario                  | Without go-pg                           | With go-pg                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Managing PostgreSQL in Go | Manual query building and scanning    | Idiomatic ORM and query builder simplifying the code|
| Handling Relationships    | Multiple queries and manual joins     | Built-in relation mapping reduces development time  |
| Transaction Management    | Boilerplate and error-prone           | Simplified transaction APIs with context support    |
| Bulk Operations           | Complex manual implementations        | Convenient batch methods increase throughput        |
| Scalability & Reliability | Risk of connection leaks or slow ops  | Automatic pooling with retries and circuit breakers |

---

## Practical Tips for Success

- **Leverage ORM relations** to reduce query complexity and improve maintainability.
- Use **context and timeout options** to ensure your queries respect time constraints and cancel appropriately.
- Combine **bulk operations** during heavy data processing to reduce latency and resource consumption.
- Enable **notifications** for reactive designs that need minimal polling overhead.
- Take advantage of **connection pooling and retry mechanisms** to improve app resilience.
