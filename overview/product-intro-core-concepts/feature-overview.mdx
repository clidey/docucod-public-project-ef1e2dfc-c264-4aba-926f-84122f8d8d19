# Key Features at a Glance

Explore the standout capabilities of **go-pg**, a robust PostgreSQL client and ORM for Go that streamlines database interaction while delivering advanced features tailored to Go developers' needs.

---

## Comprehensive SQL & ORM Support

Harness the best of both worlds with go-pg’s dual approach — intuitive ORM workflows alongside flexible SQL query building:

- **Rich ORM Patterns:** Define models and relationships easily with support for `has one`, `belongs to`, `has many`, and `many to many` associations, including composite and multi-column primary keys.
- **Composable Queries:** Build complex queries with composability, enabling subqueries, grouping, distinct clauses, locking, and unions directly from Go code.
- **Raw SQL and Query Building:** Execute raw SQL or use the query builder to craft safe, parameterized queries while benefiting from automatic struct binding.

## Advanced Data Type Handling

Go beyond standard types with built-in support for sophisticated PostgreSQL data structures:

- **Basic and Nullable Types:** Seamless handling of Go’s basic types, `sql.Null*` variants, and custom nullable time support.
- **Arrays, JSONB, and Hstore:** Map Go slices, maps, and structs to PostgreSQL’s multidimensional arrays, `jsonb` columns, and `hstore` key-value stores.
- **Composite & Custom Types:** Define and use PostgreSQL composite types for structured data, enhancing type safety and expressiveness.

## Transactions & Prepared Statements

Ensure reliability and performance in your database operations:

- **Robust Transaction Support:** Encapsulate multiple operations in explicit transactions with rollback and commit semantics.
- **Prepared Statements:** Execute repeated queries efficiently using statement preparation, reducing overhead and improving latency.

## Connection Pooling & Reliability

Go-pg automates connection management to optimize resource use under load:

- **Automatic Connection Pooling:** Effortlessly manage multiple database connections with an intelligent pool.
- **Circuit Breaker & Retry Mechanisms:** Improve resilience with built-in circuit breaking and query retry on network errors.

## Soft Deletes & Bulk Operations

Build maintainable, scalable applications with features that reduce boilerplate:

- **Soft Deletes:** Mark rows as deleted without physical removal, allowing easy recovery and audit trails.
- **Bulk Inserts, Updates & Deletes:** Efficiently handle batch database operations to speed up data modification at scale.

## Useful Utilities & Optimizations

- **Count Estimation:** Use PostgreSQL’s `EXPLAIN` to estimate row counts for faster pagination and UI responsiveness.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Write complex queries using `WITH` clauses to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Hooks (Before/After):** Define lifecycle hooks for scans and CRUD operations, enabling clean extension points for advanced workflows.

## Real-World Example: Query with Relations

Retrieve a story with its author in one query with automatic join and mapping:

```go
story := new(Story)
err := db.Model(story).
	Relation("Author").
	Where("story.id = ?", storyID).
	Select()
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

This example demonstrates how go-pg removes the friction of manually writing joins and scan code, letting you focus on your application logic.

## Helpful Tip

<Tip>
To maximize query performance, combine eager-loading using `.Relation()` with selective columns via `.Column()` to fetch only the data you need.
