# Why am I seeing import or installation errors?

This FAQ page addresses the most common errors encountered when trying to install or import the go-pg v10 module in your Go project. These issues often stem from incorrect import paths (such as missing the required `v10` suffix), problems with Go modules setup, or dependency mismatches. This guide provides clear, step-by-step solutions to help you get go-pg up and running smoothly.

---

## 1. Common Causes of Import or Installation Errors

- **Missing the `v10` Suffix in Import Path:** The most frequent mistake is importing the package without the required `/v10` suffix. For example, `import "github.com/go-pg/pg"` instead of `import "github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"`.
- **Go Modules Not Initialized or Misconfigured:** If your project is not using Go modules, or if your `go.mod` file is not correctly set up, module resolution will fail.
- **Incorrect Versioning or Module Proxy Issues:** Using an outdated version, or issues with Go proxy or cache, can prevent proper retrieval.
- **Dependency Conflicts or Version Mismatches:** Conflicting versions between dependencies can cause build or import failures.

---

## 2. How to Fix Missing or Incorrect Import Path

### Step 1: Ensure Module Initialization

Make sure your project uses Go modules by running in your project root:

```bash
go mod init github.com/your/repo
```

This creates a `go.mod` file to manage dependencies.

### Step 2: Import the Correct Package Path

Always include the `v10` version suffix when importing go-pg:

```go
import "github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
```

This is mandatory starting from go-pg v10 due to semantic import versioning.

### Step 3: Install the Package with Go Get

Run:

```bash
go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```

This will download and add go-pg to your module dependencies.

### Step 4: Verify Module Versions

Run:

```bash
go list -m all | grep go-pg
```

To confirm `github.com/go-pg/pg/v10` is listed.

### Example Minimal Setup

```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject

go mod init github.com/my/repo

go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```

Then use in Go code:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
)

func main() {
	db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
		User: "postgres",
	})
	defer db.Close()

	// Your code here
}
```

## 3. Troubleshooting Go Modules Setup Issues

- **Ensure Go is Version 1.13 or Newer:** go-pg v10 requires modules, available by default from Go 1.13+
- **Clear Module Cache:** Run `go clean -modcache` if corrupted cache suspected.
- **Check `go.mod` and `go.sum` Files:** Run `go mod tidy` to fix missing or unused dependencies.
- **Disable GOPROXY or Configure Correctly:** If behind a proxy or firewall, ensure Go proxy settings allow module fetching.

---

## 4. Handling Dependency Mismatches and Version Conflicts

If you see errors about incompatible versions or checksum mismatches:

- Run `go mod tidy` to clean dependencies.
- Check if other dependencies require conflicting versions.
- Use `go get -u github.com/go-pg/pg/v10` to update.
- If needed, manually edit `go.mod` to adjust versions.

## 5. Common Error Messages and How to Interpret Them

| Error Message                                 | Meaning & Solution                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `cannot find package "github.com/go-pg/pg"` | Forgot `/v10` suffix; update import to include `v10`. |
| `module github.com/go-pg/pg: no matching versions` | Go module proxy issue or network problem; check proxy and retry. |
| `go: inconsistent vendoring detected`          | Run `go mod tidy` to correct dependencies.             |
| `go: github.com/go-pg/pg@vX.Y.Z: unknown revision` | Invalid version requested; specify supported v10 versions. |

---

## 6. Best Practices and Tips

- Always initialize your project with Go modules (`go mod init`).
- Make sure all go-pg imports include the exact major version suffix (`v10`).
- Use the command `go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10` to fetch the correct version.
- Regularly run `go mod tidy` to keep dependencies consistent.
- Review your environment variables like `GOPROXY`, `GONOPROXY`, and `GOPRIVATE` if you have private modules or restricted access.
- For reproducibility, commit `go.mod` and `go.sum` files to your version control.

## 7. Example of a Minimal Working Go Program with go-pg v10

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
)

func main() {
	db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
		User: "postgres",
	})
	defer db.Close()

	var n int
	_, err := db.QueryOne(pg.Scan(&n), "SELECT 1")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Query result:", n)
}
```

Run with:

```bash
go run main.go
```

If this runs without error, go-pg v10 is installed and imported correctly.

<Tip>
If you see import errors, double-check your import paths to always include the `/v10` module suffix. This requirement is critical for Go modules and is a frequent source of confusion.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Do not mix go-pg v10 imports with v9 or earlier versions. Each major version uses a unique module path; mixing can cause build failures.
