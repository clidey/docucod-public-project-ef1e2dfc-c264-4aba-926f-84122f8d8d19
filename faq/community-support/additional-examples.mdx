These resources offer narrative learning with example-driven explanations and code to help you build competence step-by-step.

### What official documentation and reference materials should I consult?

Beyond these examples and tutorials, the official documentation portals provide in-depth references and API explanations:

- **Official Documentation Site:** Comprehensive, up-to-date docs covering core features, API references, and conceptual guides.  
  [go-pg Documentation](https://pg.uptrace.dev/)

- **API Reference on pkg.go.dev:** Auto-generated API docs with function signatures, types, and example usage snippets.  
  [go-pg on pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-pg/pg/v10?tab=doc)

- **Example Tests from the Codebase:** The go-pg repository includes numerous example tests which illustrate various use cases and best practices in idiomatic Go. These are valuable for seeing small, focused examples of common workflows, like model usage, relations, transactions, transactions with concurrency, query customization, and error handling.

### How do these resources fit into the overall learning path?

Start with simple tutorials and example projects to get hands-on experience. Then leverage the official documentation and example tests to deepen your understanding of advanced topics such as:

- Model relationships and joins
- Composite and custom types
- Transactions and bulk operations
- Query formatting and parameterization
- Performance best practices

### Tips for Maximizing Your Learning Experience

- **Clone and Run Example Projects:** Experiment with the projects linked above by cloning their repositories, running them locally, and exploring how `go-pg` is integrated.

- **Try Modifying Code:** Make changes to queries, models, and configurations in example projects to see how go-pg reacts.

- **Use Example Tests as Study Guides:** The example tests in the go-pg repo are condensed, practical demonstrations. Use them to learn idiomatic usage patterns.

- **Refer Back to Concepts & API Docs:** Keep the API Reference and Conceptual Guides handy to clarify specific behaviors or functionalities as you encounter them in examples.

- **Join the Community:** If you need help or want to share your progress, join the go-pg Discord or GitHub discussions for community support.

## Getting Started Example Snippet

This simple example extracted from the go-pg example tests demonstrates defining models, inserting data, and querying with relationships:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v10/orm"
)

type User struct {
	Id     int64
	Name   string
	Emails []string
}

func main() {
	db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
		User: "postgres",
	})
	defer db.Close()

	// Create table for User model
	err := db.Model((*User)(nil)).CreateTable(&orm.CreateTableOptions{
		Temp: true,
	})
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Insert a user
	user := &User{Name: "admin", Emails: []string{"admin@example.com"}}
	_, err = db.Model(user).Insert()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	// Query the user
	fetchedUser := &User{Id: user.Id}
	err = db.Model(fetchedUser).WherePK().Select()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(fetchedUser)
}
```

This snippet highlights typical steps: connecting, schema setup, inserting, and querying data.
