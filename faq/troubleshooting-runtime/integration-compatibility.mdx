# Are there compatibility issues with Go versions, PostgreSQL versions, or Bun?

This FAQ page provides clear guidance on compatibility concerns related to go-pg, including supported versions of Go and PostgreSQL, the maintenance status of go-pg, and recommendations regarding migration or integration with the newer Bun library.

---

## Maintenance Status of go-pg

- **go-pg is currently in maintenance mode.** This means that only critical issues, such as security patches or serious bugs, are addressed.
- No new feature development or enhancements are planned for go-pg.
- All active development efforts have moved to the [Bun](https://bun.uptrace.dev/guide/pg-migration.html) project, which provides similar ORM capabilities but supports multiple databases including PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.

<Tip>
If starting a new project or considering future-proofing your application, evaluate Bun as the modern successor to go-pg, offering broader database support and active feature development.
</Tip>

---

## Go Version Compatibility

- go-pg supports the **two most recent versions of Go**.
- It requires Go versions with full module support.
- To ensure compatibility and smooth operation:
  - Use a Go version from the last two major releases.
  - Ensure your environment uses module-aware tooling (`go.mod` enabled).
  - Example minimum setup:

```bash
# Initialize your module
go mod init github.com/my/repo

# Install go-pg v10 with explicit version suffix
go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```

<Tip>
Using older Go versions outside the last two supported releases may cause compilation or runtime issues.
Always check the Go version your project builds against.
</Tip>

---

## PostgreSQL Version Compatibility

- go-pg targets **PostgreSQL server versions that are actively supported by PostgreSQL's own release policies**.
- It fully supports modern PostgreSQL features and types relevant for these versions, including advanced data types like arrays, JSONB, hstore, and composite types.
- For the best stability and performance:
  - Use PostgreSQL version 11 or newer where possible.
  - Make sure your database version supports the PostgreSQL features you intend to use with go-pg.

<Note>
While go-pg may work with older PostgreSQL versions, some features or SQL syntax may not be available or fully supported.
Test your targeted PostgreSQL version thoroughly.
</Note>

## Using Bun with PostgreSQL: Migration and Integration Guidance

- Bun is the actively developed library succeeding go-pg and includes similar PostgreSQL support plus additional databases.
- Bun aims to provide:
  - Modern Go ORM design.
  - Support for multiple database backends.
  - Improved feature set aligned with recent PostgreSQL capabilities and Go idioms.

### Migration Considerations

- If you currently use go-pg and consider migrating to Bun:
  - Review Bunâ€™s migration guide: [Bun pg Migration Guide](https://bun.uptrace.dev/guide/pg-migration.html)
  - The guide covers mapping your existing models and queries to Bun's APIs.
  - Migration is non-trivial and requires code adjustments; plan and test carefully.

### Coexistence with Other Libraries

- Since go-pg is maintained for stability, you can continue to use it alongside Bun during migration.
- It is NOT recommended to mix ORM models or database connections from both libraries in the same transaction or database context.
- Use Bun for new development to leverage active improvements.

<Warning>
Avoid mixing Bun and go-pg models in the same queries or transactions to prevent conflicts or unexpected behaviors.
</Warning>

## Summary

| Compatibility Aspect         | Recommendation & Notes                                            |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Go versions**              | Use two latest Go versions with module support.                 |
| **PostgreSQL versions**      | Use PostgreSQL 11+ for best compatibility with feature support. |
| **Maintenance status**       | go-pg is maintenance-only; Bun is the recommended successor.    |
| **Migration to Bun**         | Follow Bun migration guide; don't mix with go-pg in queries.    |

## Practical Example: Verifying Go Version and Installing go-pg

```bash
# Check your Go version
go version

# Initialize a new Go module if not done
go mod init github.com/my/repo

# Install go-pg v10 explicitly (note the /v10 suffix)
go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```
