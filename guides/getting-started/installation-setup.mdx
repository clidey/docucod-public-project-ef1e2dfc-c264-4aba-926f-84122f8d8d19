# Installation and First Connection

Welcome to the foundational guide for getting started with **go-pg**, a powerful PostgreSQL client and ORM for Go. Here, you will learn how to set up your Go environment with modules, install go-pg v10, and establish your very first connection to a PostgreSQL database. This guide ensures a smooth and confident start by walking through practical steps for installation, setup, and connection verification.

---

## 1. Overview of This Guide

This guide helps you:
- Install go-pg v10 in your Go project using Go modules.
- Configure connection options for PostgreSQL.
- Establish a successful initial connection to your PostgreSQL database.
- Troubleshoot common connection problems.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.16 or later installed and configured on your system.
- Access to a running PostgreSQL server (version 9.6 or newer recommended).
- Basic familiarity with Go modules and environment variables.

### Expected Outcome
By following this guide, you will have go-pg installed as a module dependency in your project and be able to connect successfully to your PostgreSQL database, verifying connectivity with a simple SQL query.

### Time Estimate
About 10-20 minutes, depending on your environment setup.

### Difficulty Level
Beginner to Intermediate

## 2. Installing go-pg

### Step 1: Initialize Your Go Module (If Needed)
If your project does not already use Go modules, start by initializing it:

```bash
mkdir your-project && cd your-project
go mod init your-project
```

### Step 2: Add go-pg v10 as a Dependency
Use the following command to add go-pg v10 to your project:

```bash
go get github.com/go-pg/pg/v10
```

This ensures you're using the correct major version with the `/v10` suffix, which is crucial for compatibility.

### Step 3: Verify the Installation
Confirm the module is correctly added to your `go.mod` file:

```bash
cat go.mod | grep go-pg
```
It should show a line similar to:

```
github.com/go-pg/pg/v10 v10.x.x
```

<Tip>
Ensure the `/v10` suffix is included in imports; otherwise, you will face import errors.
</Tip>

## 3. Configuring Connection Options

To connect to PostgreSQL, prepare the connection options that specify how go-pg communicates with your database.

### Basic Options
The essential fields to configure in `pg.Options` are:

| Option          | Description                              | Default Value            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| `User`          | Database username                        | `postgres` (env `PGUSER`) |
| `Password`      | Database password                        | `postgres` (env `PGPASSWORD`) |
| `Database`      | Target database name                     | `postgres` (env `PGDATABASE`) |
| `Addr`          | Host and port for TCP connection        | `localhost:5432` (env `PGHOST` and `PGPORT`) |
| `Network`       | Network type (`tcp` or `unix`)           | `tcp`                   |
| `TLSConfig`     | TLS config for secure connections       | `InsecureSkipVerify` as default (allow SSL) |

The client automatically reads environment variables if options are not specified explicitly.

### Using a Connection URL
Alternatively, you can parse a PostgreSQL connection URL using `pg.ParseURL()`. The URL must follow this format:

```
postgres://username:password@host:port/databasename?sslmode=disable&application_name=myapp&connect_timeout=5
```

Supported `sslmode` values include `disable`, `allow`, `prefer`, `require`, `verify-ca`, and `verify-full`.

Example in code:

```go
options, err := pg.ParseURL("postgres://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
db := pg.Connect(options)
```

---

## 4. Establishing Your First Connection

### Step 1: Import go-pg in Your Go Code

```go
import "github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
```

### Step 2: Create Connection Options
You can configure options manually or use environment defaults:

```go
options := &pg.Options{
    User:     "postgres",
    Password: "postgres",
    Database: "postgres",
    Addr:     "localhost:5432",
}

// Or parse connection URL
// options, err := pg.ParseURL("postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable")
```

### Step 3: Connect to PostgreSQL

```go
db := pg.Connect(options)
// Always close the connection when no longer needed
// defer db.Close()
```

### Step 4: Verify the Connection
Run a simple query to confirm connectivity:

```go
var n int
_, err := db.QueryOne(pg.Scan(&n), "SELECT 1")
if err != nil {
    panic(err) // Handle connection error gracefully
}
fmt.Println("Connected successfully, test query result:", n)
```

Expected output:

```
Connected successfully, test query result: 1
```

### Step 5: Use Connection Pooling Defaults
By default, go-pg uses an efficient connection pool sized based on your CPU cores. You can customize via `PoolSize` and other fields in `pg.Options` if needed.

| Option               | Description                                                   | Default / Notes                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `DialTimeout`        | Timeout for establishing new TCP connection                   | 5 seconds                         |
| `ReadTimeout`        | Timeout for socket reads; aborts long-running commands        | 0 = no timeout                    |
| `WriteTimeout`       | Timeout for socket writes                                      | 0 = no timeout                    |
| `MaxRetries`         | How many times to retry failed queries                        | 0 (no retries by default)        |
| `RetryStatementTimeout` | Retry queries cancelled due to statement timeout            | false                           |
| `MinIdleConns`       | Minimum idle connections to create for faster acquisition     | 0                                |
| `MaxConnAge`         | Maximum age after which connection is closed and recreated    | 0 (no max age)                   |
| `PoolTimeout`        | Timeout waiting for free connection if pool exhausted         | 30s or `ReadTimeout + 1s`         |
| `IdleTimeout`        | Idle connection timeout to reclaim stale connections          | 5 minutes                        |
| `ApplicationName`    | Application name sent to PostgreSQL servers for logging      | Optional                        |

<Tip>
Use the environment variables `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, and `PGDATABASE` to simplify your configuration.
</Tip>

## 6. Troubleshooting Your First Connection

Following are common problems you may encounter and how to address them.

### Problem 1: Authentication Failure
- Check your username and password.
- Verify `pg_hba.conf` on your PostgreSQL server allows connections from your host for your user.

### Problem 2: Connection Timeout or Refused
- Ensure PostgreSQL server is running and accessible on the specified host and port.
- Confirm network connectivity, firewall settings, and that `listen_addresses` in Postgres config include your connection host.

### Problem 3: SSL/TLS Issues
- Match the `sslmode` option with your server's SSL configuration.
- Use `sslmode=disable` for unsecured local connections.
- For production environments, prefer `verify-full` with proper CA certificates for security.

### Problem 4: Pool Exhaustion Errors
- Increase `PoolSize` in options if your workload requires concurrent connections.
- Monitor connection usage and consider `MinIdleConns` to keep idle connections warmed up.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Connection Errors Troubleshooting Guide](/getting-started/troubleshooting/connection-errors) for detailed diagnostics of connection issues.

## 7. Example: Complete Minimal Connection Program

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/go-pg/pg/v10"
)

func main() {
	// Connect using default environment variables and options
	db := pg.Connect(&pg.Options{
		User:     "postgres",
		Password: "postgres",
		Database: "postgres",
		Addr:     "localhost:5432",
	})
	defer db.Close()

	var n int
	_, err := db.QueryOne(pg.Scan(&n), "SELECT 1")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Successful connection, test result:", n)
}
```

## 8. Best Practices for First Connections

- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials, avoiding hardcoding passwords.
- Always defer `db.Close()` to cleanly close connections when done.
- For local development, keep `sslmode=disable` or `allow`.
- Adjust pool sizes (`PoolSize` and `MinIdleConns`) based on your applicationâ€™s concurrency needs.
- Use `connect_timeout` in connection URLs/options to fail fast on unreachable database.

## 9. Next Steps

After establishing the connection:
- Learn to define your database models using Go structs.
- Practice performing basic CRUD operations.
- Explore transactions and advanced query patterns.
